### Many people studied cancer prediction to detect malignant patterns in histopathology slides from tissue images. Most have used deep learning models, particularly CNN to extract features from the image. But, CNN will check whether it is malignant. If we have labeled with cancer stage then we can predict the stage at most and nothing more than that. Here I will propose one method that not only extracts the information of malignancy and stage of it but also some other information if it has. For that, we will use the vision language model (VLM). 
### VLM can be used for many purposes, but here I will use it for image captaining. However, any open-source model for image captaining is trained on general data. As I want to work in a particular domain, I need to fine-tune the model. After fine-tuning the model, we can pass an image that I want to detect and it will return a description of the image which is called a caption. Now, I can check how accurate the generated caption is by a text-image model. If the accuracy is not up to the mark, then I can pass the caption to an LLM model to improve the caption. Check the accuracy of the caption with the image, and repeat this method until reach the desired accuracy. Finally, we will get the final caption.
